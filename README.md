**Hey, I'm Azmoth** 


**I build stuff sometimes, interested in low-level architecture, logic, math, neuroscience, physics, writing and tech.** 

🔭 I’m currently working on a time machine [Don't worry, this will make sense as time unfolds - hehe].

👨‍💻 I'm looking forward to building new fundamental paradigms and protocols for the internet through web3.

💬 Ask me about: Math, physics, logic, analytic philosophy, web3.

⚡ Fun fact: My maxim is "logic first in all things."
